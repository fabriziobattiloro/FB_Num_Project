%
% Function that performs the inexact newton optimization method, 
% implementing the backtracking strategy.
%
% INPUTS:
% x0 = n-dimensional column vector;
% f = function handle that describes a function R^n->R;
% gradf = function handle that describes the gradient of f;
% Hessf = function handle that describes the Hessian of f;
% kmax = maximum number of iterations permitted;
% tolgrad = value used as stopping criterion w.r.t. the norm of the
% gradient;
% c1 = ï»¿the factor of the Armijo condition that must be a scalar in (0,1);
% rho = ï»¿fixed factor, lesser than 1, used for reducing alpha0;
% btmax = ï»¿maximum number of steps for updating alpha during the 
% backtracking strategy.
% fterms = function handle taking as input arguments k and gradfk, and 
% returning the forcing term etak
% pcg_maxit = maximum number of iterations for the pcg solver
%
% OUTPUTS:
% xk = the last x computed by the function;
% fk = the value f(xk);
% gradfk_norm = value of the norm of gradf(xk)
% k = index of the last iteration performed
% xseq = n-by-k matrix where the columns are the xk computed during the 
% iterations
% btseq = 1-by-k vector where elements are the number of backtracking
% iterations at each optimization step.
